Makani (the Hawaiian word for wind 🍃🌺) is a library designed to enable the research and development of the next generation of machine-learning (ML) based weather and climate models in PyTorch. Makani was used to train [FourCastNet3 [1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12144v2), [Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO) [2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03838) for weather (FourCastNet2), [Huge ensemble of SFNO (HENS-SFNO) [3,4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03100), and [FourCastNet1 [5]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11214).

Makani is aimed at researchers working on ML based weather prediction. Stable features are frequently ported to the [earth2studio](https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2studio) and the [NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo](https://developer.nvidia.com/physicsnemo) framework. For commercial and production purposes, we recommend checking out these packages.

## Overview

Makani is a research code developed by engineers and researchers at NVIDIA and NERSC for massively parallel training of weather and climate prediction models on 100+ GPUs and to enable the development of the next generation of weather and climate models. Makani is written in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and supports various forms of model- and data-parallelism, asynchronous loading of data, unpredicted channels, autoregressive training and much more. Makani is fully configurable through .yaml configuration files and support flexible development of novel models. Metrics, Losses and other components are designed in a modular fashion to support configurable, custom training- and inference-recipes at scale. Makani also supports scalable, fully online scoring modes, which are compatible with WeatherBench2. Among others, Makani was used to train the [FourCastNet](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2025-07_fourcastnet-3-geometric-approach-probabilistic-machine-learning-weather) models, on the ERA5 dataset.

## Getting started

Makani can be installed by running

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA/makani.git
cd makani
pip install -e .
```

### Training:

Makani supports ensemble and deterministic training. Ensemble training is launched by calling `ensemble.py`, whereas deterministic training is launched by calling `train.py`. Both scripts expect the CLI arguments to specify the configuration file `--yaml_config` and he configuration target `--config`, which is contained in the configuration file:

```bash
mpirun -np 8 --allow-run-as-root python -u train.py --yaml_config="config/fourcastnet3.yaml" --config="fcn3_sc2_edim45_layers10_pretrain1"
```

Makani supports various optimization to fit large models ino GPU memory and enable computationally efficient training. An overview of these features and corresponding CLI arguments is provided in the following table:

| Feature                   | CLI argument                                  | options                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Batch size                | `--batch_size`                                | 1,2,3,...                    |
| Ensemble size             | `--ensemble_size`                             | 1,2,3,...                    |
| Automatic Mixed Precision | `--amp_mode`                                  | `none`, `fp16`, `bf16`       |
| Just-in-time compilation  | `--jit_mode`                                  | `none`, `script`, `inductor` |
| Activation checkpointing  | `--checkpointing_level`                       | 0,1,2,3                      |
| Channel parallelism       | `--fin_parallel_size`, `--fout_parallel_size` | 1,2,3,...                    |
| Spatial model parallelism | `--h_parallel_size`, `--w_parallel_size`      | 1,2,3,...                    |
| Ensemble parallelism      | `--ensemble_parallel_size`                    | 1,2,3,...                    |
| Multistep training        | `--multistep_count`                           | 1,2,3,...                    |
| Skip training             | `--skip_training`                             |                              |
| Skip validation           | `--skip_validation`                           |                              |

Especially larger models are enabled by using a mix of these techniques. Spatial model parallelism splits both the model and the data onto multiple GPUs, thus reducing both the memory footprint of the model and the load on the IO as each rank only needs to read a fraction of the data. A typical "large" training run of SFNO can be launched by running

```bash
mpirun -np 256 --allow-run-as-root python -u makani.train --amp_mode=bf16 --multistep_count=1 --run_num="ngpu256_sp4" --yaml_config="config/sfnonet.yaml" --config="sfno_linear_73chq_sc3_layers8_edim384_asgl2" --h_parallel_size=4 --w_parallel_size=1 --batch_size=64
```
Here we train the model on 256 GPUs, split horizontally across 4 ranks with a batch size of 64, which amounts to a local batch size of 1/4. Memory requirements are further reduced by the use of `bf16` automatic mixed precision.

### Inference:

Makani supports scalable and flexible on-line inference aimed at minimizing data movement and disk I/O, which is well suited to the low inference costs of ML weather models and modern HPC infrastructure. In a similar fashion to training, inference can be called from the CLI by calling `inference.py` and handled by `inferencer.py`. To launch inference on the out-of-sample dataset, we can call:

```bash
mpirun -np 256 --allow-run-as-root python -u makani.inference --run_num="ngpu256_sp4" --yaml_config="config/sfnonet.yaml" --config="sfno_linear_73chq_sc3_layers8_edim384_asgl2" --batch_size=64
```

By default, the inference script will perform inference on the out-of-sample dataset and compute the mtrics. The inference script supports model, data and ensemble parallelism out of the box, enabling efficient and scalable scoring. The inference script support additional CLI arguments which enable validation on a subset of the dataset, as well as writing out inferred states:

| Feature                   | CLI argument                                  | options                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Start date                | `--start_date`                                | 2018-01-01+UTC00:00:00       |
| End date                  | `--end_date`                                  | 2018-12-31+UTC24:00:00       |
| Date step (in hours)      | `--date_step`                                 | 1,2,...                      |
| Output file               | `--output_file`                               | file path for field outputs  |
| Output channels           | `--output_channels`                           | channels to write out        |

### Model and Training configuration
Model training in Makani is specified through the use of `.yaml` files located in the `config` folder. The corresponding models are located in `modelf` and registered in the model registry in `models/model_registry.py`. The following table lists the most important configuration options.

For a more comprehensive overview, we suggest looking into existing `.yaml` configurations. More details about the available configurations can be found in [this file](config/README.md).

### Training data
Makani expects the training/test data in HDF5 format, where each file contains the data for an entire year. The dataloaders in Makani will then load the input `inp` and the target `tar`, which correspond to the state of the atmosphere at a given point in time and at a later time for the target. The time difference between input and target is determined by the parameter `dt`, which determines how many steps the two are apart. The physical time difference is determined by the temporal resolution `dhours` of the dataset.

Makani requires a metadata file named `data.json`, which describes important properties of the dataset such as the HDF5 variable name that contains the data. Another example are channels to load in the dataloader, which arespecified via channel names. The metadata file has the following structure:

```json
{
    "dataset_name": "give this dataset a name",     # name of the dataset
    "attrs": {                                      # optional attributes, can contain anything you want
        "decription": "description of the dataset",
        "location": "location of your dataset"
    },
    "h5_path": "fields",                            # variable name of the data inside the hdf5 file
    "dims": ["time", "channel", "lat", "lon"],      # dimensions of fields contained in the dataset
    "dhours": 6,                                    # temporal resolution in hours
    "coord": {                                      # coordinates and channel descriptions
        "grid_type": "equiangular",                 # type of grid used in dataset: currently suppported choices are 'equiangular' and 'legendre-gauss'
        "lat": [0.0, 0.1, ...],                     # latitudinal grid coordinates
        "lon": [0.0, 0.1, ...],                     # longitudinal grid coordinates
        "channel": ["t2m", "u10", "v10", ...]       # names of the channels contained in the dataset
    }
}
```

The ERA5 dataset can be downloaded [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview).

### Checkpoints and restarting

Makani supports 2 checkpointing formats `legacy` and `flexible`. By default, makani uses the `legacy` format, which saves the model, optimizer and scheduler state dicts into a file for each model parallel rank. This enables restoring the run in the same model-parallel configuration, including optimizer and scheduler states. Alternatively, if a different model-parallel configuration needs to be chosen, the `flexible` format can be used to restore the model in another configuration. Unfortunately, support for restoring optimizer states in this manner is still experimental. Which format is used for saving and restoring is determined by the

Makani offers a conversion script to convert `legacy` checkpoints into `flexible` checkpoints. It can be run by calling `python -u makani.convert_checkpoint` script.

### Model packages

By default, Makani will save out a model package when training starts. Model packages allow easily contain all the necessary data to run the model. This includes statistics used to normalize inputs and outputs, unpredicted static channels and even the code which appends celestial features such as the cosine of the solar zenith angle. Read more about model packages [here](networks/Readme.md).

### Data Processing Scripts Overview

The folder `data_process` contains a collection of scripts in order to modify data input files or compute statistics on them.

#### Core Data Processing
`annotate_dataset.py` - Adds metadata annotations to HDF5 files including timestamps, latitude/longitude coordinates, and channel names. Ensures uniform time information across datasets by converting to UTC timezone.
`concatenate_dataset.py` - Creates virtual HDF5 datasets by combining multiple year files into a single dataset without physical copying, reducing disk overhead.
`h5_convert.py` - Reformats HDF5 files to enable compression and chunking. Supports various compression modes (LZF, GZIP, SZIP, scale-offset) and chunking strategies for optimized storage and access.
Statistics and Analysis
`get_stats.py` - Computes comprehensive statistics from datasets including global means, standard deviations, min/max values, time means, and time-difference statistics. Supports MPI for distributed processing.
`get_histograms.py` - Generates histograms from dataset distributions, useful for data analysis and validation. Also supports MPI for distributed processing.
`postprocess_stats.py` - Post-processes computed statistics by correcting water channel minima to exactly 0.0 and clamping standard deviations to prevent numerical issues.

#### WeatherBench2 Integration
`generate_wb2_climatology.py` - Generates WeatherBench2-compatible climatology data and ground profile masks from ERA5 data (1990-2019 averages). Creates HDF5 datasets with user-specified channel selection and ordering.
`convert_wb2_to_makani_input.py` - Converts ARCO-ERA5 data (WeatherBench2 format) to Makani-compatible HDF5 format. Handles channel name translation and data restructuring.
`convert_makani_output_to_wb2.py` - Converts Makani inference outputs to WeatherBench2 format for evaluation and comparison with other models.
`merge_wb2_dataset.py` - Transfers specific channels between Makani HDF5 files. This can be used for channels which are present in Copernicus ERA5 but not on ARCO-ERA5 (such as 10m wind speeds).
`wb2_helpers.py` - Utility functions for WeatherBench2 integration, including channel name translation between Makani and WeatherBench2 conventions for both surface and atmospheric variables.

This collection of scripts provides a complete pipeline for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and WeatherBench2 compatibility for weather forecasting models.
